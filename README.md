A while ago, I was interviewing for a software developer role at a startup and I ended up withdrawing because I had need no idea how to build the small project they wanted as a test.
It wasn't anything complex just a metronome but it had to be with react and at the time I didn't know anything about react.
Since then I've been improving my skills in javascript and have decided to make what I should have made back then.

This is a simple metronome, but instead of just selecting a tempo with a slider or some buttons, there is one button. You press it twice to set the tempo you want and then it outputs the clicks at that tempo.
